  abstract = {Environmental research requires understanding nonlinear ecological dynamics that interact across multiple spatial and temporal scales. The analysis of long-term and high-frequency sensor data combined with simulation modeling enables interpretation of complex ecological phenomena, and the computational skills needed to conduct these analyses are increasingly being integrated into graduate student training programs in ecology. Despite its importance, however, computational literacy—that is, the ability to harness the power of computer technologies to accomplish tasks—is rarely taught in undergraduate ecology classrooms, representing a major gap in training students to tackle complex environmental challenges. Through our experience developing undergraduate curricula in long-term and high-frequency data analysis and simulation modeling for two environmental science pedagogical initiatives, Project EDDIE (Environmental Data-Driven Inquiry and Exploration) and Macrosystems EDDIE, we have found that students often feel intimidated by computational tasks, which is compounded by the lack of familiarity with software (e.g., R) and the steep learning curves associated with script-based analytical tools. The use of prepackaged, flexible modules that introduce programming as a mechanism to explore environmental datasets and teach inquiry-based ecology, such as those developed for Project EDDIE and Macrosystems EDDIE, can significantly increase students’ experience and comfort levels with advanced computational tools. These types of modules in turn provide great potential for empowering students with the computational literacy needed to ask ecological questions and test hypotheses on their own. As continental-scale sensor observatory networks rapidly expand the availability of long-term and high-frequency data, students with the skills to manipulate, visualize, and interpret such data will be well-prepared for diverse careers in data science, and will help advance the future of open, reproducible science in ecology.},

  abstract = {A modern evidence and value-driven healthcare system must have the capacity to learn and adapt—to track performance in real-time and generate and apply information for future improvements in safety, quality, and value of care received. As information technologies supporting clinical documentation continue to advance, the volume of clinical data generated in the natural course of care rapidly grows. Understanding, accessing, managing, and interpreting the widening variety of healthcare data available requires coordination of resources, efforts, and incentives to ensure that researchers, clinicians, and patients have access to the right data, in the right context, at the right time (Detmer, 2003; Kawamoto and Ginsburg, 2009; NRC, 2009). Integrated datasets and other approaches to link data and broaden or share findings only extend the potential to use these data to learn what works in health care. Fostering broader access to and appropriate use of these data will be key to progress—and will require both cross-sector discussions to better characterize the technical, organizational, and legal barriers that currently limit the use of existing and emerging data resources and cooperative action to address these challenges (Arrow et al., 2009; Piwowar et al., 2008). These and other issues were the focus of discussion at the Institute of Medicine (IOM) Roundtable on Value \& Science-Driven Health Care’s February 2008 workshop, Clinical Data as the Basic Staple of Health Learning: Creating and Protecting a Public Good (Box 1-1).},

The mission of Data Carpentry is to provide researchers high-quality, domain-specific training covering the full lifecycle of data-driven research. This mission is achieved through the development and implementation of workshops taught on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research. Data Carpentry is a sibling organization of Software Carpentry, though its focus is on the introductory computational skills needed for data management and analysis in all domains of research. Data Carpentry lessons are domain specific, and range from life and physical sciences to social science. Lessons build upon the existing knowledge of learners to enable them to quickly apply the skills they learn to their own research. Data Carpentry learners are asked to complete pre- and post-workshop surveys. This report is an analysis of the post-workshop survey responses collected for 40 Data Carpentry workshop sites. Purpose The analysis in this report serves the following purposes: To inform the community of the impact Data Carpentry workshops have made on its learners. To provide context for the survey responses as they relate to Data Carpentry learners. To discuss what Data Carpentry is doing well, areas of improvement, and questions we should be asking.},

  abstract = {Computationally-intensive, cross-disciplinary research collaborations are difficult to create and maintain over time, though many yield impressive results. The need for researchers to share, maintain, and manage data is increasing, while also integrating new tools and approaches to make their work more impactful. The University Libraries at Virginia Tech has a team of disciplinary data and informatics consultants working to connect research environments on campus with emerging library services enabling collaboration across disciplines. Partnerships with university-level research service providers, such as high-performance computing (HPC) services and statistical data consulting, have presented interesting use cases and innovative solutions to common problems. While traditional library services may not overlap with high performance computing environments, new library services (such as data management, publishing, curation, archiving, and preservation) provide new avenues for collaboration and situate the libraries in a unique position in relation to research ecosystems. Moving large datasets from HPC environments into research environments present significant barriers to research data sharing between collaborators; working with libraries to make these datasets better organized and documented lowers some of these barriers. Discipline-specific informatics consulting allows researchers to integrate new tools and approaches to solve research questions. Here, we highlight the utilization, need, and scope of informatics and research data management services in and around libraries, while also providing examples of how these services have created new collaborations and adoption of improved research practices surrounding data management and integration of computationally intensive techniques (e.g. bioinformatics, humanistic informatics, etc.). This work lays the foundation for these services in an academic setting and the influence of such on the practice and experience of understanding data.},

  abstract = {The Persona Lifecycle is a field guide exclusively focused on interaction design's most popular new technique. The Persona Lifecycle addresses the "how" of creating effective personas and using those personas to design products that people love. It doesn’t just describe the value of personas; it offers detailed techniques and tools related to planning, creating, communicating, and using personas to create great product designs. Moreover, it provides rich examples, samples, and illustrations to imitate and model. Perhaps most importantly, it positions personas not as a panacea, but as a method used to complement other user-centered design (UCD) techniques including scenario-based design, cognitive walkthroughs and user testing. The authors developed the Persona Lifecycle model to communicate the value and practical application of personas to product design and development professionals. This book explores the complete lifecycle of personas, to guide the designer at each stage of product development. It includes a running case study with rich examples and samples that demonstrate how personas can be used in building a product end-to-end. It also presents recommended best practices in techniques, tools, and innovative methods and contains hundreds of relevant stories, commentary, opinions, and case studies from user experience professionals across a variety of domains and industries. This book will be a valuable resource for UCD professionals, including usability practitioners, interaction designers, technical writers, and program managers; programmers/developers who act as the interaction designers for software; and those professionals who work with developers and designers.},

  abstract = {Infusing data literacy into a curriculum is an unrealized opportunity for higher education to truly make an impact on the current generation as they prepare to move into the workforce. This chapter describes the design and structure of a new, unique undergraduate elective course introduced into the curriculum of a large, public University in the Northeastern United States. The design of the course is designed to inspire an “evidence-based” mindset, encouraging students to identify and use data relevant to them in their field of study and the larger world around them. The chapter includes the course goals mapped to specific learning objectives, examples of exercises and assignments, a reading list, and a course syllabus. Instructors and institutions interested in bringing data science concepts to a broad audience can use this course as a foundation to build their own curriculum in this area.},

  abstract = {The era of big data has arrived. Big data bring us the data-driven paradigm and enlighten us to challenge new classes of problems we were not able to solve in the past. We are beginning to see the impacts of big data in every aspect of our lives and society. We need a science that can address these big data problems. Data science is a new emerging discipline that was termed to address challenges that we are facing and going to face in the big data era. Thus, education in data science is the key to success, and we need concrete strategies and approaches to better educate future data scientists. In this paper, we discuss general concepts on big data, data science, and data scientists and show the results of an extensive survey on current data science education in United States. Finally, we propose various approaches that data science education should aim to accomplish.},

  abstract = {Background The Internet has become a major source of health related information. Nursing students, as future healthcare providers, should be skilled in locating, using and evaluating online health information. Aim The main purpose of this study was to assess eHealth literacy among nursing students in Jordan, as well as to explore factors associated with eHealth literacy. Methods A descriptive cross sectional survey was conducted in two universities in Jordan, one public and one private. A total of 541 students completed the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS). Some additional personal and demographical variables were collected to explore their relation to eHealth literacy. Results Students have a moderate self-perceived level of eHealth literacy (M=3.62, SD=0.58). They are aware of the available online health resources and know how to search, locate, and use these resources. Yet, they lack skills to evaluate them and cannot differentiate between high and low quality resources. Factors that are related to eHealth literacy include type of university, type of student admission, academic level, students' internet skills, and their perception of the usefulness and importance of the internet. On the other hand, age, gender, grade point average (GPA), and frequency of internet use were found not to significantly affect eHealth literacy. Conclusion This study represents a baseline reference for eHealth literacy in Jordan. Students have some of the necessary skills, while others still need to be improved. Nursing educators and administrators should incorporate eHealth literacy skills into the curriculum.},

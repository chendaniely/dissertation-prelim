  abstract = {A modern evidence and value-driven healthcare system must have the capacity to learn and adapt—to track performance in real-time and generate and apply information for future improvements in safety, quality, and value of care received. As information technologies supporting clinical documentation continue to advance, the volume of clinical data generated in the natural course of care rapidly grows. Understanding, accessing, managing, and interpreting the widening variety of healthcare data available requires coordination of resources, efforts, and incentives to ensure that researchers, clinicians, and patients have access to the right data, in the right context, at the right time (Detmer, 2003; Kawamoto and Ginsburg, 2009; NRC, 2009). Integrated datasets and other approaches to link data and broaden or share findings only extend the potential to use these data to learn what works in health care. Fostering broader access to and appropriate use of these data will be key to progress—and will require both cross-sector discussions to better characterize the technical, organizational, and legal barriers that currently limit the use of existing and emerging data resources and cooperative action to address these challenges (Arrow et al., 2009; Piwowar et al., 2008). These and other issues were the focus of discussion at the Institute of Medicine (IOM) Roundtable on Value \& Science-Driven Health Care’s February 2008 workshop, Clinical Data as the Basic Staple of Health Learning: Creating and Protecting a Public Good (Box 1-1).},

  abstract = {The Persona Lifecycle is a field guide exclusively focused on interaction design's most popular new technique. The Persona Lifecycle addresses the "how" of creating effective personas and using those personas to design products that people love. It doesn’t just describe the value of personas; it offers detailed techniques and tools related to planning, creating, communicating, and using personas to create great product designs. Moreover, it provides rich examples, samples, and illustrations to imitate and model. Perhaps most importantly, it positions personas not as a panacea, but as a method used to complement other user-centered design (UCD) techniques including scenario-based design, cognitive walkthroughs and user testing. The authors developed the Persona Lifecycle model to communicate the value and practical application of personas to product design and development professionals. This book explores the complete lifecycle of personas, to guide the designer at each stage of product development. It includes a running case study with rich examples and samples that demonstrate how personas can be used in building a product end-to-end. It also presents recommended best practices in techniques, tools, and innovative methods and contains hundreds of relevant stories, commentary, opinions, and case studies from user experience professionals across a variety of domains and industries. This book will be a valuable resource for UCD professionals, including usability practitioners, interaction designers, technical writers, and program managers; programmers/developers who act as the interaction designers for software; and those professionals who work with developers and designers.},

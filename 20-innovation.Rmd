Innovation
==========

**Our work creates and validates a survey that can be used in the biomedical science to create learner personas.**
We've adapted survey questions from other educators to create 4 surveys:
self-assessment, pre-workshop, post-workshop, and long-term workshop.
These surveys are general enough to capture data literacy, programming, and statistics knowledge,
while also being domain specific and flexible to be adapted to other domains.
We've also validated these surveys so they can be used for further studies and as a tool for educators

**The learning materials we have created are the only ones that link the data literacy skills to the overall data science process.**
Many books around data science mainly focus on the actual model fitting and evaluation of the data science process.
Other books on data processing go through too many data processing details without having meaningful payoffs.
The content we have created using a backwards design approach always frames key data science steps in the
context of data literacy and data processing pipelines.
This creates a more holistic set of topics that are taught at the point of need,
while highlighting avenues for further learning.

**Our experiments will teach us more about learning data science and data literacy skills, not simply programming and computer science concepts.**
A lot of literature around computer science education is focused on the programming and topics
used in computer science classes.
The formative question types used in computer science education informs the types of questions
used in data literacy and data science, however,
little is known about what formative question topics inform learning objectives in data sciecne curriculum.

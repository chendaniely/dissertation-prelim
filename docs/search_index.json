Existing data science learning materials usually lack one of the following features community oriented follow a creative commons license maintained accessible clearly display target audience and learning objectives (education and pedagogy) modernize the biomedical data-resouce ecosystem, promote Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reuseable (FAIR) principles, enhance the the data science and research workforce in the biomedical sciences. The accelerating changes in medical education incorporating data science compentencies indicate the growing need of data science education in the biomedical sciences. Most important information bits of information of need, in order Meaningful use + HITECH Act insentivised all medical records to be electronic by 2014, and by 2020 more than 89% of all hospitals have implemented an EHR system. While EHR systems thave their own data challenges, the influx of electronic data has called for changes in how clinicians undergo training to meet the challenges of evidenced-based medicine using these data. By contextualizing and democratizing the data science skills for clnicians we can provide them more capacity explore and make better use of the data. by empowering the people using and working with better data lit/sci skills, we can build the workforce needed to better use and collect the data we need to innovate and progress healthcare Programming courses are generally considered difficult with high dropout rates. Motivation and mindset are some of the intergral roles in learning programming and building life-long learners. A backward design approach using learner personas for creating lessons help keep teaching focused on objectives and help cater the needs of the learner to the overal learning objectives. Data science tools are built around tidy data principles, a core data literacy topic on how to process data. Once the lessons are created, it can be freely shared (CC-0) and adapted to individual instructor needs, but the core “tried and true” tested content can remain unchanged and improved. Gap in knowledge Essential pieces that are missing, critical problem, or critical need that will be addressed in proposal We are missing the learner personas in the biomedical field Missing learner self-assessment surveys that can be used to identify personas Missing community oriented, open, and maintained lessons targeting learner persona needs grounded in pedagogical practices and theory While we know a lot about the teaching and pedagogy of computer science education, less is known about data literacy education, and almost nothing is known about data science education.

Create a set of CC-0 lessons for the biomedical community to learn data science skills. Assess the effectiveness of the lesson materials. "],["hypothesis.html", "Chapter 5 Hypothesis", " Chapter 5 Hypothesis Hypothesis: Learning materials with an eye towards tidy data principles is an effective way to teach the data science and data literacy skills that will help learners incorporate programming and data science skills from their spreadsheet workflows. Learning material effectiveness will be guaged with surveys, which will introduce survey response biases. How hypothesis is formulated: Data science tools are built around inputs that are defined by tidy data principles. Spreadsheet programs make it easy to treat data sets as a visualization, which make the data less flexible for multiple uses Lesson efficacy will be tested against learning objectives It is possible programming may not be incorporated by learners, but data may be curated better "],["statement-of-need.html", "Chapter 6 Statement of Need", " Chapter 6 Statement of Need Statement of rationale Bridge the skills gap between medical practitioners and domain experts in the biomedical sciences with the analysts, researchers, and data scientists to make better use of data (storage, FAIR, stewardship) in data science teams by creating a computational community of practice that can enhance workforce development, modernize the data ecosystem, work with data science tools for sustainable and open science.

General background, perception of needs, and special considerations will be added to make each learner persona a complete character. Aim 2: Create a data science for biomedical science curriculum based on best education and pedagogy practices. 2.1: Learning objectives focused around core data literacy principles in the data science pipeline will be used for each lesson module. 2.2: Lesson content are created in blocks that can be remixed in classroom or workshop formats both in-person and virtually. Aim 3: Assess the short-term and long-term effectiveness of the curriculum based on learning objectives. 3.1: Pre/post workshop survey looking at changes to learning objectives. 3.2: Post workshop will have a self-reported summative assessment question (i.e., final exam question). 3.3: Long-term survey will assess whether materials helped with retaining the fundamental knowledge. 3.4: Workshop will have formative assessments to see if students are meeting learning objectives.

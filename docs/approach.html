<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>While there is a lot of literature and studies on computer science education,
very little is known about data literacy education, and even less on data
science education. Since data science skills inherently involve programming
<span class="citation">(Dolgopolovas and Dagienė, <a href="#ref-dolgopolovasComputationalThinkingEnhancing2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>; Farrell and Carey, <a href="#ref-farrellPowerPitfallsPotential2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>; Song and Zhu, <a href="#ref-songBigDataData2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>,
there are synergies between the educational and pedagogical approach to teaching
data science, however, little is known about what key concepts are needed to
engage into the larger data science process and what learning objectives that
need to be taught, and the effectiveness of those learning objectives.</p>
<p>This work will create community-oriented, open, maintained, and focused data
science learning materials for the medical and biomedical sciences. To this end,
in Aim 1, we lay the groundwork for understanding potential learners by
identifying and creating learner personas, fictional characters that represent a
typical type of learner, by creating and validating a set of self-assessment
surveys. In Aims 2 and 3, we create and assess the effectiveness of the learning
materials, the workshop that teaches the materials, and the implementation of
formative and summative assessment questions to see if learning objectives are
met. As a collective whole, we will better understand the needs of our learners
and create a data science curriculum that meets their needs while providing a
solid data literacy foundation that can be used to continue learning <span class="citation">(Farrell and Carey, <a href="#ref-farrellPowerPitfallsPotential2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The long-term implications of this work are to bridge the skills gap between
medical practitioners and domain experts in the biomedical sciences with the
analysts, researchers, and data scientists to make better use of data (storage,
FAIR, stewardship) in data science teams by creating and bolstering a
computational community of practice that can enhance workforce development,
modernize the data ecosystem, work with data science tools for sustainable and
open science.</p>
</div>
<div id="hypothesis" class="section level2" number="4.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Hypothesis</h2>
<p>Our central hypothesis is that learning materials with an eye towards the
learner and tidy data principles is an effective way to teach the data science
and data literacy skills that will help learners incorporate programming and
data science skills from their spreadsheet workflows. Data science tools are
built around inputs that are defined by tidy data principles. Spreadsheet
programs make it easy to treat data sets as a visualization, which makes the
data less flexible for multiple uses. It is possible programming may not be
incorporated by learners, but these materials may help curate better datasets
that can be used in data science teams. To address these critical gaps in
knowledge, we will create a set of surveys that will inform us of the potential
learners and assess the effectiveness of the learning materials. Lesson efficacy
will be tested against learning objectives.</p>

<h3>Aim 1: Identify learner personas in the biomedical sciences by creating and validating learner self-assessment surveys.</h3>
<p>Assessing the prior knowledge of potential learners in the medical and
biomedical sciences who are interested in learning data science skills by
creating a learner self-assessment where participants rate their own comfort in
data, statistics, and programming skills.</p>
<div id="working-hypothesis" class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
<h4>Working Hypothesis</h4>
<p>We <em>hypothesize</em> that learners will fall across the 3 main groups of the Dreyfus
model of skill acquisition: novice, intermediate, and expert. These groups will
be distinguishable based on their own comfort in 3 domains of data science
(data, programming, and statistics knowledge). To test this, we will create a
learner self-assessment survey. The survey will cover data, programming, and
statistics knowledge and will have at least 2 questions asking about the same
underlying concept for internal consistency. Results from the survey along with
demographic information will be combined to create the personas. These personas
will be used to inform the learning objectives for lesson materials.</p>
</div>
<div id="preliminary-data-for-aim-1." class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
<h4>Preliminary Data for Aim 1.</h4>
<p>In preliminary studies, we found that we were able to cluster the respondents
into 4 clusters using hierarchical clustering with Euclidean distance and Ward’s
method. We then combined these clusters with the occupation question to come up
with the 4 learner personas: clinicians (novice), academics (intermediate),
students (intermediate), and programmers (experts). This gives us the framework
we can use to expand the study to a larger population to both validate the
survey instrument and the results.</p>
<div id="learner-self-assessment-survey-asking-questions-about-prior-programming-statistics-and-data-knowledge-will-be-used-to-create-learner-personas." class="section level5 unnumbered" number="">
<h5>1.1: Learner self-assessment survey asking questions about prior programming, statistics, and data knowledge will be used to create learner personas.</h5>
<p>We will send out self-assessment surveys to various medical and biomedical
groups around the Virginia Tech campus. We collected preliminary data over the
summer of 2020 and had 51 participants consented to the survey.
Figure <a href="approach.html#fig:surveySelfGroupedDemographics">4.1</a>
shows
the grouped distribution of responses to the occupation demographic question
(this is a select-all-that-apply question).</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 4.1: <strong>Grouped demographic counts.</strong> Occupation counts from learner self-assessment survey aggregated into one of the 3 groups shown. Each respondant had the option to select more than one occupation that applies to themself.
</p>
</div>
<p>In general, we found that the overall group has low programming skills with
basic data analysis skills primarily using Excel. They do not understand how
data pipelines are created, and do not know how data can be processed into
different “shapes” for analysis. An important framing of the materials would be
to start with spreadsheet programs and tie their use into more advanced skills
using programming languages
<span class="citation">(Farrell and Carey, <a href="#ref-farrellPowerPitfallsPotential2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The survey also asks a summary Likert scale table of questions
(Figure <a href="approach.html#fig:surveySelfLikert">4.2</a>).
These results confirm the overall findings where respondents typically do not
use a programming language in their work and are indifferent towards programming
in doing analysis. They did report that having access to the original raw data
is important to repeat an analysis. This let us conclude that
<strong>there is a lack of knowledge in the data literacy fundamentals where data can be
transformed from user-friendly data curation formats to analysis-friendly
formats in multiple pipeline steps.</strong></p>

<h5>1.2: Validate learner self-assessment survey.</h5>
<p>The survey was designed with the questions in duplicate for internal validity,
i.e., each construct was asked in 2 separate questions. These questions can be
validated using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Exploratory Factor
Analysis (EFA) results. The EFA results can also be used to simplify the survey
to a representative set of questions. These questions can be used in future
surveys to gain the same amount of information about learners without asking the
entire battery of questions in our self-assessment survey. EFA was also used to
simplify he survey down to 3 question, one for each of the knowledge domains.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="approach.html#fig:personaPCACumProp">4.3</a>
shows how half of the questions (8 out of 16) account for more than 90% of the
variance in PCA, with the first component accounting for 46% and 3 components
accounting for 68%. Since our survey was designed using 3 main constructs:
programming, statistics, and data knowledge, these results show that the survey
was well designed and has internal consistency among the respondents. We also
conducted an exploratory factor analysis on our preliminary data, and used 3
factors, one for each latent variable. The question loadings also followed the
constructs in the survey, suggesting the validity of the survey. We would need
to expand the survey to more participants to show its external validity. Given
the preliminary data, we propose to perform more validation checks by increasing
the sample size. We will be able to calculate the Cohen’s kappa coefficient to
measure inter-rater reliability and the larger sample size will improve the
external validity of the survey.</p>

<h5>1.3: Personas will encompass a student’s prior knowledge using survey data. General background, perception of needs, and special considerations will be added to make each learner persona a complete character.</h5>
<p>We used hierarchical clustering with Euclidean distance and Ward’s method on our
preliminary data to create the learner personas
(Figure <a href="significance.html#fig:dendogram4">2.3</a>).</p>
<p>This approach is validated from preliminary results showing the 4 learner
personas from our data. We combined these groupings back with the survey
occupation demographics to create the relevant prior knowledge portion of
learner personas. Our preliminary data returns 4 personas that map on to the
different stages of the Dreyfus model of skill acquisition: clinicians (novice),
academics (intermediate), students (intermediate), and programmers (experts).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="anticipated-results-and-their-impact." class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
<h4>Anticipated results and their impact.</h4>
<p>Preliminary results indicate that we can validate the learner self-assessment
survey and use the survey results to create learner personas. This gives us an
overview of the audience we would potentially teach in the medical and
biomedical sciences. Since the final step of persona creation combines the
demographic information, the base survey questions can be used across other
domains, not just the one we are studying. This potentially gives us a tool to
accurately gauge data science learners to better create learning materials for
their needs.</p>
</div>
<div id="potential-pitfalls-alternative-approaches-and-future-directions." class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
<h4>Potential pitfalls, alternative approaches, and future directions.</h4>
<p>The major route of data collection in this Aim is based on survey responses.
This inherently means we will have reporting and response bias. The demographic
breakdown in our learner self-assessment was diverse
(Figure <a href="approach.html#fig:surveySelfGroupedDemographics">4.1</a>),
but our preliminary data was only collected from Virginia Tech students and
faculty from biomedically relevant listservs. Future directions would include
increasing the survey pool to get a better representation of potential learners.
A larger survey pool would also help with the survey validation by potentially
surveying a more diverse population and increase our N for the analysis. Our
initial survey had 57 respondents, where 51 consented to the study, and 45
responses were used for the analysis. These results were from a convenience
sample from listservs at the university</p>

<div id="aim-2-create-an-effective-data-science-for-biomedical-science-curriculum-based-on-best-education-and-pedagogy-practices." class="section level3 unnumbered" number="">
<h3>Aim 2: Create an effective data science for biomedical science curriculum based on best education and pedagogy practices.</h3>
<p>Creating materials that are community-oriented, open, maintained, accessible,
follows best pedagogical practices, and domain-specific is a key component to
creating authentic tasks to aid in learner motivation. Using the feedback from
learners to assess the learning materials, we can create more relevant learning
modules, and the surveys and feedback system can be adapted to create other
domain-specific learning materials.</p>
<div id="working-hypothesis-1" class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
<h4>Working Hypothesis</h4>
<p>We <em>hypothesize</em> that a data science curriculum focused on data literacy
principles from working with spreadsheet data will be the most relevant to our
learners. We also <em>hypothesize</em> that the learning objectives we create will give
the learner confidence in performing their own data analysis after going through
the materials. By catering to the learner’s needs, and teaching the data
literacy fundamentals, learners will be more motivated to continue learning on
their own. To test this hypothesis, we will create a set of pre-workshop,
post-workshop, and long-term workshop surveys. Since this is an observational
study, we will use the learner’s confidence on their ability to accomplish a
task as a proxy for meeting learning objectives. There will be a set of
self-assessment and learning objective tasks that will be asked across all
surveys to measure differences in response longitudinally.</p>
</div>
<div id="preliminary-data-for-aim-2." class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
<h4>Preliminary Data for Aim 2.</h4>
<p>. A data science curriculum based on learner personas was created and used to
teach a set of workshops. Preliminary data collected before and after the
workshop compare a learner’s confidence of meeting learning objectives and show
that the learners are more confident in their skills and learning objectives
(Figure <a href="approach.html#fig:surveyPostLikertDiffSelfAssessment">4.4</a>

<p>These results came from 3 workshops, totaling of 72 registrants (Oct: 27, Feb:

We estimate we would need to run at least 12 more workshops to get enough
respondents for the post-workshop responses. For the long-term survey (6
months), we may need to provide a financial incentive for participants to get
enough responses.</p>

<h5>2.1: Learning objectives focused on core data literacy principles in the data science pipeline will be used for each lesson module.</h5>
<p>In this sub aim, we will create a data science curriculum that ties together
data literacy and data management pipelines with the skills used in data
science. Our preliminary learner personas guided us to use spreadsheet programs
(e.g., Excel, LibreOffice, Google Sheets, etc.) as the first lesson module to
orient the learners and use “tidy data principles” as the underlying theme to
transform data. Preliminary data and a survey of available lesson materials show
that there is a gap in available teaching materials that link data literacy
concepts of data management and processing with other steps in the data science
process. The initial modules will cover spreadsheets and data literacy basics,
loading data into a programming language, tidy data principles, plotting, and
logistic regression. Additional modules will cater to the feedback survey from
the learners.</p>

<h5>2.2 Lesson content follow best educational and pedagogical best practices.</h5>
<p>The lesson materials created will follow the best educational and pedagogical
best practices for learning programming. This includes: (1) using a
backwards-design approach to formulate the learning objectives from formative
assessment questions
<span class="citation">(Wilson, <a href="#ref-wilson2019teaching" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>;
(2) blocks of content that fit roughly 50-minute segments to allow for breaks
and formative assessments
<span class="citation">(Farrell and Carey, <a href="#ref-farrellPowerPitfallsPotential2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.
The materials are also created to work in the context of classroom “periods”;
(3) live-coded workshops where the instructor has learners follow along as the
concepts are taught and discussed
<span class="citation">(Farrell and Carey, <a href="#ref-farrellPowerPitfallsPotential2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>;
(4) code of conduct for learners to feel safe in the learning environment

(5) live captioning during the workshop event and descriptive alternative text
for each figure and image in the online materials to work with screen readers
for accessibility. By creating materials that assume no prior knowledge of

post-workshop survey. Survey participants will have a unique identifier that can
be used to track individual differences and be aggregated to look at the overall
effect changes before and after the workshop. Preliminary data shows that
learner’s confidence in various tasks and learning objectives do improve after
the workshop. A long-term survey will be sent out to workshop participants to
see retention of learning objectives, if learners found the workshop useful, and
if learners have continued to learn and work on their own projects.</p>

<h4>Anticipated results and their impact.</h4>
<p>We anticipate that a lesson curriculum that incorporates existing tools and
prior knowledge of spreadsheets will help learners fill in gaps of their data
literacy mental model when working with data in data science projects. By
focusing on data literacy concepts, we are building a curriculum that promotes
FAIR principles. This aim will create a tested learning curriculum that can be
adapted into many teachings and learning formats. The book can be done as
supplemental reading or as self-paced reading, the slides provide major points
that can be used in a lecture or presentation, and recordings are provided to
learners either as a reference or material for new learners who cannot attend a
live workshop setting. These materials lay the groundwork for a
community-oriented, open, accessible, and pedagogically sound curriculum that
can be used to enhance the data science and research workforce in the biomedical
sciences and adapted to other domains.</p>

<h4>Potential pitfalls, alternative approaches, and future directions.</h4>
<p>Our preliminary data shows more reporting bias than our learner self-assessment
survey. Most of the respondents from the workshop surveys are students, and not
from the other occupation groups. This problem can be remedied by conducting
more workshops to collect more data which may offset the bias. Our surveys
mainly measure the learner’s confidence towards a learning objective as a proxy
for a summative assessment. These results are self-reported and may show
response bias.</p>

<h3>Aim 3: Assess the effectiveness of formative assessments in learning objectives.</h3>
<p>Formative assessments “forms” the teaching in real time by informing the
instructor what concepts learners are getting wrong
<span class="citation">(Wilson, <a href="#ref-wilson2019teaching" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>.
At the end of a lesson, a summative assessment can be used to assess learners
about all of the individual concepts integrated together.
<span class="citation">Ambrose et al. (<a href="#ref-ambrose2010learning" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>
tells us that “goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback are
critical to learning.” Examining if automatic grading systems can be combined
with informative feedback can lead to better learning outcomes can identify
techniques to improve the democratization of data science education.</p>
<div id="working-hypothesis." class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
<h4>Working Hypothesis.</h4>
<p>We <em>hypothesize</em> that formative assessments with targeted and informative feedback
about incorrect solutions, will allow learners to complete formative and
summative assessment questions with a higher rate of success. We expect that
guiding learners with Parson’s problems and Faded in formative feedback
exercises will help them solve summative feedback questions faster.</p>
</div>
<div id="preliminary-data-for-aim-3." class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
<h4>Preliminary Data for Aim 3.</h4>
<p>Our hypothesis is based on computer science education literature that uses
different question types for formative assessment questions to aid in learning
content. These question types (Faded examples and Parson’s problems) are used in
lieu of a blank box where the learners write code from scratch because it lowers
the cognitive load of the learners and allows them to focus on the key aspect of
the coding exercise, instead of wrestling with the syntax of the code.</p>
<div id="implement-an-experiment-for-conducting-formative-and-summative-assessment-question-types." class="section level5 unnumbered" number="">
<h5>3.1: Implement an experiment for conducting formative and summative assessment question types.</h5>
<p>The <code>shinysurveys</code> R package provides the framework needed to create and
administer an experimental study that can be used to collect response data from
user submitted code. It leverages the learnr R package that allows instructors
to create lesson materials with an input field that can execute code. The
<code>gradethis</code> library can be used to check R and Python code for the correct result
to provide feedback to the student. <code>gradethis</code> also can check the syntax of the
code itself to point to an exact part of the code that is incorrect, instead of
giving a programming error or non-meaningful “incorrect” message. <code>shinysurveys</code>
can be used in conjunction with the tools and techniques from “Data Science in a
Box” to collect the responses from the student for analysis using the <code>learnrhash</code>
library. These responses are “hashed” such that all the data that is encoded is
resented in plain text, but indecipherable to the user.</p>
</div>
<div id="assess-the-effectiveness-of-targeted-feedback-in-auto-grading-systems-used-in-formative-and-summative-feedback." class="section level5 unnumbered" number="">
<h5>3.2: Assess the effectiveness of targeted feedback in auto-grading systems used in formative and summative feedback.</h5>
<p>In this aim, we will show an improvement in the success rate of assessment
questions when targeted feedback about the incorrect solution is given by the
learner. We recognize the importance of feedback in the learning process
<span class="citation">(Ambrose et al., <a href="#ref-ambrose2010learning" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>,
but it is not possible to give real-time feedback during many assessment
questions, especially when teaching at scale. We hope to take the results from
our implementation of <code>shinysurveys</code> and “Data Science in a Box” to collect
learner assessment performance and compare the differences between learners who
are given several types of assessment questions from those who are simply given
an empty box to type code with and without informative feedback from the
auto-grader. We currently have a population of students in our own lab,
DataBridge, with new data science learners who can be used to take entire
workshops and/or short modules where the results from the formative and
summative assessments can be recorded.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="anticipated-results-and-their-impact.-2" class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
<h4>Anticipated results and their impact.</h4>
<p>We predict an improvement in speed and correct responses in students’ final
summative assessment when they are given who are given question types rather
than an empty text box in the formative assessment. While these question types
are used in computer science education literature, these techniques have not
been studied yet to show whether adding the cognitive load of completing a data
related task helps with learning the materials. We anticipate that these results
will give future educators the types of questions that can be used for formative
assessments when teaching.</p>
</div>
<div id="potential-pitfalls-alternative-approaches-and-future-directions.-2" class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
<h4>Potential pitfalls, alternative approaches, and future directions.</h4>
<p>The study will aim to only teach a single portion of the overall lesson
materials, it is possible that the amount of information used for this aim will
be either too simple or too complex for participants given the time constraints.
If that is the case, we may resort to only looking at the amount of time to
complete a solution, rather than comparing if the distinct groups are answering
the question correctly. An additional set of workshops are also going to be
planned to include the data collection portion of this aim. Since the workshop
is going to be more time intensive, there will be a bias in the participants who
sign up to attend the study. This aim will provide the basis of incorporating a
formative and summative assessment system that can be used in a live teaching
environment so the instructor can get feedback about topics and concepts that
the learners are grasping. These results will be combined with the demographic
information with the learners and can be combined with our persona results to
curate a better learning curriculum for our learners.</p>

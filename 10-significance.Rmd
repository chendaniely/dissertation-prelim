# Significance

<u><b>Importance of the problem to be addressed.</u></b>
2,314 exabytes of new medical data was projected to have been produced in 2020
[@stewartHealthcareDataVolume2020]. This sheer volume of health data
necessitates the understanding, accessing, managing, and interpreting of data
across researchers, clinicians, and patients
[@instituteofmedicineusroundtableonvaluescience-drivenhealthcareClinicalDataBasic2010].
By democratizing data science skills for clinicians and other biomedical
professionals, they will be able to better understand their patient population,
better communicate with research teams to improve the outcomes of patients, and
be better advocates for their patients. However, existing data science learning
materials in the medical and biomedical sciences lack one of the following
features: (1) is community oriented, (2) has an open creative commons license,
(3) is maintained, (4) is accessible, and (5) follows education and pedagogy
best practices to target learning objectives (6) domain specific. These are
features that would modernize the biomedical data-resource ecosystem, promote
Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles, and enhance
the data science and research workforce in the biomedical sciences.

The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act
of 2009 included the concept of Electronic Health Records - Meaningful Use
(EHR-MU), which incentivized all medical records to be electronic by 2014.
Currently, in 2020 more than 89% of all hospitals have implemented an EHR
system. While EHR systems have their own data challenges, the influx of
electronic data has called for changes in how clinicians undergo training to
meet the challenges of evidenced-based medicine by using these data. By
contextualizing and democratizing data science skills for clinicians, we can
provide them more capacity to explore and make better use of the data
[@krossDemocratizationDataScience2020]. Additionally, by empowering those in or
interested in a biomedical profession with better data literacy and data science
skills, we can expand the workforce needed to better use and collect the data we
need to innovate and progress health care. We can accomplish this by learners to
the programming tools used for data analytics.

Programming courses are generally inaccessible for someone with a different
domain base with high dropout rates [@ogierEnhancingCollaborationResearch2018].
Motivation and mindset are some of the integral roles in learning programming
and building life-long learners [@ambrose2010learning]. A backward design
approach using learner personas for creating lessons help keep teaching focused
on objectives and help cater the needs of the learner to the overall learning
objectives [@wilson2019teaching]. The prevalence of excel as a data tool guided
us to focus on how spreadsheets fit in the data science pipeline and how data
literacy concepts, particularly the concept of "tidy data", can be taught using
spreadsheets. Data science tools are built around "tidy data" principles, a core
data literacy topic describing how the rows and columns of a data set need to be
specified for analysis. Once the lessons are created, it can be freely shared
(e.g., using a CC-0 creative commons license) and improved upon, and also has
the flexibility to be adapted to individual instructor needs.

There is emphasis and need to center materials for individuals in biomedical
fields that center around tidy data principles because the data science process
requires a tidy dataset to begin the cycle of understanding the data before
results can be communicated (Figure @ref(fig:r4dsDs)).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
r4ds_ds_caption <- "Figure taken from the R for Data Science book [@wickhamR4ds]."
```

```{r r4dsDs, fig.cap=r4ds_ds_caption, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/hadley/r4ds/raw/master/diagrams/data-science.png")
```

Unfortunately, the process of understanding and drawing conclusions from data is
not this linear, and requires many smaller feedback loops (Figure
@ref(fig:dsFigure)). Notably, data science products usually end up with some
decision or action that will affect the world. This makes each step of the data
science process influential to the final set of decisions. Notably, each step of
the data science pipeline is a data set, and the data literacy skills needed to
process and work with the data in each step is paramount to the final results.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ds_figure_caption <- "Steps in a data science pipeline showing the mini feedback loops that affect the final decision which will have some consequence in the world [@Chen2020]."
```

```{r dsFigure, fig.cap=ds_figure_caption, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/chendaniely/data_science-figure/raw/main/fig/data_science_figure.png")
```

This proposal seeks to address the following knowledge gaps in the literature
and needs in the field of training biomedical professionals: (1) There are no
formal learner personas for the biomedical community and the assessment tools to
identify and create learner personas do not exist. (2) Data science learning
materials for the biomedical sciences lack community oriented, open, and
maintained lessons targeting learner persona needs grounded in pedagogical
practices and theory. (3) While we know a lot about the teaching and pedagogy of
computer science education, less is known about data literacy education, and
almost nothing is known about data science education in an applied domain (e.g.
biomedical sciences).

<u><b>Rigor of Prior Research Supporting the Aims</u></b>

**Aim 1: Identify learner personas in the biomedical sciences by creating and validating learner self-assessment surveys.**

Personas are detailed fictional characters based on well-understood and highly
specified data to facilitate user-centered design
[@pruittPersonaLifecycleKeeping2006; @zagallo2019through]. Learner personas
encompass a learner’s general background, prior relevant knowledge, perception
of needs, and special considerations [@wilson2019teaching]. These personas can
be used along with a backwards lesson design method to keep teaching focused on
learning objectives, and keep assessment materials within the scope of the
learning materials [@wilson2019teaching]. To identify the learner personas,
adaption of questions from The Carpentries (insert citations), "How Learning
Works" [@ambrose2010learning], and "Teaching Tech Together"
[@wilson2019teaching] and focused on 3 knowledge domains: programming knowledge,
data knowledge, and statistics knowledge will be created. This learner
self-assessment study will be critical in determining who will engage in this
material, what needs exist in the current spectrum of knowledge, and avenues to
deliver content and competencies. Personas will be crafted based on the 3
knowledge domains in data science and will be sent out to list serves and
results can be clustered to identify personas using hierarchical clustering
[@zagallo2019through].

**The personas created can help future educators in the biomedical sciences
teaching data science skills focus their content, so they are relevant to the
population and address their needs. The survey and persona clustering
methodology can be adapted and utilized to create data science materials for
other professional domains.**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dendo_caption <- "Shows the 4 clusters created from the hierarchical clustering using euclidean distance and ward's.
These cluster assignments were then combined with the survey responses to identify the personas.
From left to right: experts, clinicians, students, and academics."
```

```{r dendogram4, fig.cap=dendo_caption, echo=FALSE}
fs::file_copy(here::here("../dissertation-analysis/output/persona/dendogram_4.png"),
              here::here("./figs/"), overwrite = TRUE)
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("./figs/dendogram_4.png"))
```

Previous studies and preliminary data highlights the ability of clustering to
identify personas (Figure \@ref(fig:dendogram4)) shows the persona clustering.
The identified clusters were combined with the original survey data to fill in
each persona’s prior relevant knowledge and background. The perception of needs
and special considerations were created to make each persona complete but not
based on survey data. A future qualitative study would be needed to get a more
accurate background, need, and special considerations for the personas
[@zagallo2019through]. Preliminary data also suggests that the survey is
internally consistent and valid. However, a larger sample size across a wider
geographic area would be needed to externally validate the survey.

**Aim 2: Create an effective data science for biomedical science curriculum based on best education and pedagogy practices.**

Create a data science curriculum for the biomedical sciences using a backwards
design approach. This puts the learning objectives, formative and summative
assessment questions at the forefront of the lesson material to keep them
focused and in the scope of the lesson [@wilson2019teaching]. Learners who want
to learn how to perform data analysis, typically, also need to learn data
literacy skills to learn how to obtain and manipulate data
[@miloInformationLiteracyStatistical2005]. Tidy data principles will be employed
as the guiding concept of data literacy [@wickhamTidyData2014] to focus our
learning objectives. Best practices on education and pedagogy dictate small,
focused lessons and reinforce the learning objectives by creating a series of
formative assessments [@wilson2019teaching; @ambrose2010learning]. To test the
content and effectiveness of the materials and its learning objectives, we use a
series of pre-workshop and post-workshop surveys to determine learner’s
confidence in the learning objectives (TODO: carpentries citation).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
lo4_caption <- "Shows the changes from the pre-wokshop and post-workshop responses. The numbers show the differences from the pre-workshop counts, from the post-workshop counts. White (0) means there was a net 0 difference between reponses. Blue represents where more responses went to after the workshop and red represents the number of people who migrated from a particular response after the workshop."
```


```{r lo4, fig.cap=lo4_caption, echo=FALSE}
fs::file_copy(here::here("../dissertation-analysis/output/survey/03-post_workshop/diff-likert-learning_objectives.png"),
              here::here("./figs/"), overwrite = TRUE)
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("./figs/diff-likert-learning_objectives.png"))
```

A long-term survey will be sent out to respondents to see how their confidence
with the same set of learning objectives have changed over 6 months, to see how
learners may have retained and built on the knowledge from the workshop. There
is a final summative assessment question in both the post-workshop and long-term
survey. **The surveys and learning materials will serve as the first set of
community oriented, open with a creative commons license, accessible, follows
best pedagogical practices, and domain specific.** Maintainability needs to be
accessed over longer periods of time, but organizations like the carpentries
provide a community and mechanism where these materials can be migrated to after
the initial curriculum assessment is complete to find other lesson maintainers
in their incubator and lab community lessons. The surveys will be published to
be used in other workshops and adapted to other domains.

**Aim 3: Assess the effectiveness of formative assessments in learning learning objectives**

-->

Formative assessments are a pedagogical tool that instructors use to identify
learner’s misconceptions [@wilson2019teaching]. In order to reduce the cognitive
load on the learners, various types of assessment questions can be used. Parsons
problems take a block of solution code, scramble the order of the lines, and ask
the learner to assemble to code back into the correct execution order
[@wilson2019teaching]. Faded examples provide working code snippets with some
amount of the code "blanked out" [@wilson2019teaching]. Parson’s problems allow
the learner to focus on the overall steps and flow of the thought process, and
faded examples focus the learner’s attention to a specific part of the code.
Both provide some kind of scaffolding mechanism for the student, so they are not
writing code from scratch. **These assessments will look for time to complete
and solution correctness as a measure of meeting the learning objectives. It
will also be the first set of data science specific formative assessments
focused on data literacy topics, and not basic programming concepts in the
computer science literature.** By using the learning materials from Aim 2 and
the assessment tools focused on learning objectives we will create a summative
assessment question. We expect to have better learning outcomes in the learners
when concepts are reinforced with formative assessment questions that guide the
learner to aspects of the code that are incorrect, rather than simply telling
them the solution they provided is incorrect (Figure
@ref(fig:postSummativeAssessment)).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
post_summative_assessment_caption <- "Shows the responses to a summative assessment question at the end of the workshop. The question asked the learners about a learner's comfort in loading a tabulated dataset, tidy it up, and perform a small analysis."
```


```{r postSummativeAssessment, fig.cap=post_summative_assessment_caption, echo=FALSE}
fs::file_copy(here::here("../dissertation-analysis/output/survey/03-post_workshop/Q5.1.png"),
              here::here("./figs/"), overwrite = TRUE)
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("./figs/Q5.1.png"))
```

<u><b>Significance of the Expected Research Contribution</u></b>

Upon successful completion of the proposed studies, we expect our contribution
to be a framework of how to create domain specific data science learning
materials. The learner personas developed in Aim 1 will be used when teaching
data science to new learners in the medical and biomedical sciences. The surveys
used to create the personas can be used to other domains which can inform
instructors about their learners. In addition, we are performing one of the few
studies to date that look in to how students learn in a data literacy and data
science context, in connectivity to an applied field, not in a computer science
context. *This contribution is expected to be significant because of the growing
need in the biomedical workforce for data science education. We are not only
creating data science learning materials following best education and
pedagogical practices, but also creating a curriculum in the biomedical sciences
domain along with the tools and framework for expanding the content to other
domains.* Additionally, formative assessment questions will be measured for
their effectiveness in learning the data science and data literacy contexts.
